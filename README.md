# AI for Good Hackathon 2020
2.5 days of using machine learning to support climate action by predicting and preventing forest disasters.

## The Problem
Our planet is already suffering the consequences of climate change. We have recently seen the devastating consequences of wildfires in Australia, with researchers claiming that as temperature rises, do does the risk of wildfires around the world of becoming common.
There is an urgent need to address the effects of climate change, and AI for Good can be a driving force to prevent disasters an help us act at the right time.

## The solution
Satellite imagery and remote sensor data present the opportunity to develop machine learning models that allow not only to predict potential threats and plan accordingly, but also to implement sustainable solutions for the future. By using computer vision and image analysis for example, robust predictions can be made about forest areas, their risk and their potential for sustainable development.

### Possible outcomes
- Accurate risk assessments and prevention of forest fires
- Estimating carbon stock
- Categorisation of trees and impact on air quality in the area and other variables

## The Challenge
- Build machine learning models that would predict the likelihood of a severe disaster occurring: bush fires, etc.
- Predict the impact of those disasters
- Build machine learning models that allow to have preventive measures in place in case of disaster
- Predict the impact of preventive measures in place and best practice approaches
- and more!

Participants will work in cross-functional teams, tackle one or more (but not limited to) of the following tasks based on their expertise:
1.	Categorisation of trees and areas based on satellite imagery
2.	Estimating tree height based on ML models simulating LiDAR
3.	Presence (or not) of trees and relationship with air quality
4.	Trees dependent on time for a given area
5.	Carbon density and its influence
6.	Fire prediction
